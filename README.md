SSL/TLS Encryption: Encrypts email content in transit, preventing interception by unauthorized parties during transmission.

SMTP Authentication: Verifies the senderâ€™s identity before email delivery, reducing the risk of email spoofing.

SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Validates sender IP addresses against DNS records, preventing unauthorized sources from sending emails on behalf of your domain.

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Adds a digital signature to emails, ensuring their authenticity and integrity by verifying the sender's domain.

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance): Provides alignment for SPF/DKIM, enabling policy enforcement and reporting to prevent email fraud.

MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent-Strict Transport Security): Enforces TLS encryption for email servers, ensuring secure transmission and preventing downgrade attacks.

BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification): Displays verified brand logos in recipients' inboxes, enhancing brand trust and email credibility.

Anti-Phishing Filters: Identifies and blocks malicious emails designed to steal sensitive information through deceptive links or attachments.

Spam Filtering: Filters out unwanted and potentially harmful emails based on content, sender reputation, and known patterns.

Attachment Scanning: Examines email attachments for malware, ensuring that harmful files are quarantined before reaching the recipient.

URL Defense: Analyzes links within emails for malicious intent, protecting users from phishing and malware attacks.

Email Encryption at Rest: Encrypts stored emails, safeguarding sensitive information against unauthorized access on servers and backup systems.
